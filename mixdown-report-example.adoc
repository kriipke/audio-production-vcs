Track:: Midnight Circuit
Version:: v1.0
Date:: Aug 25, 2025
Engineer:: Example Mastering Studio

== General Notes
* Strong arrangement and solid groove foundation.
* Club energy is present but hi-hats feel rushed.
* Bass competes with kick in the low end.

== Frequency Balance
Sub/Bass (20–80Hz):: Sub present but slightly uncontrolled around 60Hz; suggest -2dB cut @ 60Hz with Q=2.
Kick vs Bass:: Kick transient masked; apply 4–6dB sidechain compression on bass (fast attack, medium release).
Low-Mids (150–300Hz):: Noticeable buildup at 220Hz; cut -2dB on mix bus.
High-Mids (2–5kHz):: Percussion sharp at 4kHz; apply dynamic EQ dip.
Highs (8–16kHz):: Hats bright but brittle; shelf down -1.5dB @ 12kHz.

== Dynamics & Loudness
* Integrated Loudness (LUFS):: -9.8 LUFS (slightly hot for premaster).
* Peak Level:: -0.1dBFS (leave -3dB headroom).
* Dynamic Range (DR):: DR 6 (acceptable but could breathe more with kick/bass clarity).

== Stereo Image & Spatial
* Good stereo spread on synths and FX.
* Hi-hats overly wide; pull 15–20% more center for mono compatibility.
* Reverb on clap overlaps with groove; shorten decay or apply ducking.

== Timing / Groove
* Hi-hats ahead by ~5–10ms; creates “rushed” perception.
* Percussion groove otherwise solid.

== Element Notes
Kick:: Punchy but buried under bass; consider parallel compression for transient snap.
Bass:: Wide subs; apply HPF at 30Hz and mono-sum below 100Hz.
Hi-Hats & Percussion:: Bright but rushed; align and tame highs.
Clap/Snare:: Good presence; transient shaping for more snap.
Synths:: Balanced but muddy around 500Hz; cut gently.
FX:: Reverb tails overlap; trim or EQ highs out of FX return.

== Recommendations
. Tighten hi-hat alignment to reduce rushed feel.
. Apply sidechain compression on bass against kick.
. Clean up low-mids with a dip around 220Hz.
. Reduce highs slightly with a shelf around 12kHz.
. Leave -3dB headroom and export 24-bit WAV for mastering.
